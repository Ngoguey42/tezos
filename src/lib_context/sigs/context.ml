      folding over a value is a no-op.

      The depth is 0-indexed. If [depth] is set (by default it is not), then [f]
      is only called when the conditions described by the parameter is true:

      If [order] is [`Sorted] (the default), the elements are traversed in
      lexicographic order of their keys. For large nodes, it is memory-consuming,
