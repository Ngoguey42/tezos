      This is expected to be used as follows:

      - The node runs a function [f] over a tree [t]. While performing
        this computation, the node records: the hash of [t] (called [before]
        below), the hash of [f t] (called [after] below) and a subset of [t]
        which is needed to replay [f] without any access to the node's storage.
        Once done, the node packs this into a proof [p] and sends this to the
        client.

      - The client generates an initial tree [t'] from [p] and computes [f t'].
        Once done, it compares [t']'s hash and [f t']'s hash to [before] and
        [after]. If they match, they know that the result state [f t'] is a
        valid context state, without having to have access to the full node's

      These proofs encode large directories into a tree-like structure. This
      reflects irmin-pack's way of representing nodes and computing
      hashes (tree-like representations for nodes scales better than flat
      representations).

      [length] is the total number of entries in the children of the inode.
      It's the size of the "flattened" version of that inode. [length] can be
      used to prove the correctness of operations such [Tree.length] and
      [Tree.list ~offset ~length] in an efficient way.

      [proofs] contains the children proofs. It is a sparse list of ['a] values.
      These values are associated to their index in the list, and the list is
      kept sorted in increasing order of indices. ['a] can be a concrete proof
      or a hash of that proof.

    (** Stream proofs represent an explicit traversal of a Merle tree proof.
        Every element (a node, a value, or a shallow pointer) met is first
        "compressed" by shallowing its children and then recorded in the proof.

        As stream proofs directly encode the recursive construction of the
        Merkle root hash is slightly simpler to implement: verifier simply
        need to hash the compressed elements lazily, without any memory or
        choice.

        Moreover, the minimality of stream proofs is trivial to check.
        Once the computation has consumed the compressed elements required,
        it is sufficient to check that no more compressed elements remain
        in the proof.

        However, as the compressed elements contain all the hashes of their
        shallow children, the size of stream proofs is larger
        (at least double in size in practice) than tree proofs, which only
        contains the hash for intermediate shallow pointers. *)
